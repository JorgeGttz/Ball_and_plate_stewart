# Ball_and_plate_stewart
This is a project for show the difference between control PID serie and PID paralell.

We try to explain throgth of this project a visual way of show the difference with two algorithms of control PID serie and paralell. 
The platform stewart-gough is a parallel robot in witch we can move it of simultaneous way and all dicreections. The platform stewart-gough can move in axis (yaw,picth,roll) and in translate (x,y,z), although we only need axis (picth,roll) to show the objective of this project. However, We decided to use this model as it has better stability, greater precision and better presentation despite its complexity. If you need more information about all project, I invite you to read the doc TESIS.
